{"name":"Polyu","tagline":"PolyU Application","body":"<h2>As You Step Into the Page...</h2>\r\nYou look at the surrounding trees. It is a forest. You can hear birds chirping in nearby trees.\r\n\r\n<p><i>Cynthia Fong,</i> you mutter under your breath. Impressive sight, but where is the applicant? At that same moment, something large, in four paws, looms forward.\r\n\r\n<p>That some<i>thing</i> turns out to be a tiger—or is it? Its muscles definitely resembles that of a tiger’s, you observe, seeing as power radiates from each pawstep as it bounds towards you. However, those stripes…  it is easily the most magnificent creature that you have ever seen.\r\n\r\n<p>It gets nearer and nearer. Somehow, its gleaming eyes tell you the big cat is not going to attack you. Your shoulders relax, calmly waiting for its next move, unflinching.\r\n\r\n<p>You kind of expect it to come in front of you. It then puts a paw in front of itself and crouches down to a bow.\r\n\r\n<p>But that is not even the most surprising part. It can <i>speak</i>. \r\n\r\n<p>“Welcome,” it opens its mouth and deep down its throat comes out a rumbling sound. Even its voice, thick and deep, radiates power. \r\n\r\n<p>“This is the application of Miss Fong, for the <i>Animation</i> subject in the <i>Multimedia</i> faculty of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.”\r\n\r\n<p>”The applicant herself is not coming?” you ask.\r\n\r\n<p>”Oh, not at all,” it purrs. “Miss Fong is coming. I am just here to meet you, since I think I know the way around here best.”\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Wait, Who?<h2>\r\nHowever, the large feline does not stop there.\r\n\r\n<p>”I can tell you more of her while we wait...”\r\n\r\n<p><b>Name:</b> Fong Cynthia Chloe\r\n<br><b>Address:</b> 11D Block 2 Site 7, Whampoa Garden, Kowloon\r\n<br><b>E-mail:</b> myself.fong@gmail.com\r\n<br><b>Date of Birth:</b> 24/01/1995 (DD/MM/YYYY)\r\n<br><b>Education:</b> Pui Ching Primary and Secondary Schools, Benenden School (in the UK), and in Excel London College at the moment\r\n<br><b>Qualifications:</b> Please see below:\r\n<p><div style=overflow:scroll;width:400px;height:200px>*this is a scroll-box for qualifications*</div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Likes</h2>\r\n“Oh. She does have a bit of interests,” it says, one of its paws pointing to a tree. As you look closer, there are words carved onto the main branch.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Reading & Films.</b> Cynthia enjoys reading and watching movies, as long as they are about unrealistic plots, such as fantasy. She believes that fantastical stories provide a form of escapism after a day’s tiring (not necessarily boring) work.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Music.</b> She does know how to play the oboe. <u>She achieved Grade 8 and participated in the Hong Kong Children’s Symphony Orchestra and other school orchestras. </u>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Travelling.</b> Speaking of orchestras, she travelled with the orchestras to perform in different countries such as the UK, the US, Canada, Vienna, etc.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Computing.</b> Having knowledge in computers, she uses computing to assist her on some of her hobbies. For example, she can use the art programme Photoshop and knows HTML. <u>This website will hopefully prove her web- designing and character-designing skills.</u>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Documentaries.</b> Documentaries about animals. Animals are her inspiration for her designs. She is also deeply fascinated by their interesting habits and appearances. Biology is one of her favourite subjects.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Board Games.</b> Just a relatively minor interest. She is a hobbyist chess player. <u>She has also led the school in a Scrabble competition and won at the Primary School category.<u>\r\n\r\n<li>Last but certainly not the least...\r\n\r\n<p><b>Design & Animation!</b>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, she draws <i>all</i> the time, to design characters. She honestly cannot think of a day when she did <i>not</i> lift up a pencil. It is what she absolutely <i>loves</i> about—designing.\r\n\r\n<p>To her, there is really no difference in design and animation. The first time she saw character design of a full-length animated film, it felt just right—those two things definitely belong together!\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe “tiger” is still at your side as you are reading. When you finish, you turn towards it, about to ask it what to do next.\r\n\r\n<p>It suddenly lifts its beautiful head, seemingly catching up some scent in the air.\r\n\r\n<p>”Sorry, I am late,” another figure pants. She steps out from the shadows, this time definitely walking in two legs.\r\n\r\n“This is Miss Fong,” the creature introduced.\r\n\r\n<h2>So, What Have You Got to Say, Cynthia Fong?</h2>\r\n“Dear Sir/Madam...” Cynthia started weakly.\r\n\r\n<p>You watch on intently.\r\n\r\n<p>*Ahem*...\r\n\r\n<p>She clears her throat, then goes on.\r\n\r\n<p>I would really, really love to take up character designing, and apply the knowledge learnt here to my future career.\r\n\r\n<p>Why, you may ask?\r\n\r\nAs most personal statements would have started off with, I have been largely keen on sketching random stuff at a young age. I used to practice on pieces of draft paper, and wallpapers even! Whenever you see me with some crayons and a surface, you see messy scribbles.\r\n\r\nI decided to choose something so specific such as Character Design is because I watched an (amazing) animated series a few years ago and saw revamps of certain comic-book characters. I was totally awe-struck then—the designs were stunning! The designs only had slight changes, yet it was the small details that greatly improved viewers’ experience of viewing the animation, was fascinating. The graphics in visual medias matter a lot to me. I watch them in hopes to be entertained by beautiful art. For example, I definitely would not enjoy a show if the characters looked like blobs. I was so inspired by those amazing pieces of work that I am drawing redesigns at the moment, even after all those years.\r\n\r\nI would like to contribute to the animation industry since I am still watching them and they hold a special place in my heart. Watching so-called “cartoons” at the age of 18 is nothing to be ashamed of, as long as they are good! After all, cartoon-making is an actual business!\r\n\r\nOf course, I also would want to design characters for movies, plays, games and such! I do enjoy watching programmes where participants have to design anything, such as Face Off, where people had to design makeup for their models.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, having a brain injury at an early age means that my choices of schools are limited. I used to study in the UK for two years, completing Art for GCSE level. I was flown back to Hong Kong due to the injury that happened during my stay there, and had not studied Art ever since. Most schools nearby did not have Art.\r\n\r\nHaving to choose from only a few subject choices, I have been studying Chinese, English, Maths, Chemistry, and most notably Biology for my A-Levels. My interest for the living organisms taught in Biology inspires most of my designs and artwork. Along with my academic knowledge, I watch documentaries in free time for yet more inspiration.\r\n\r\nNow, I know that Design is slightly different from Art—it is not just about drawing. You also have to, well, design! Drawing is not a problem for me and I love it, but at the same time I long for a more creative aspect of this hobby of mine.\r\n\r\nPolyU will be the place where I can prove my dedication to that subject. I strongly desire that this place can fulfill my wish of being able to do take up my beloved subject again.\r\n\r\nI draw with either both traditional pen and paper, or with something called a ‘tablet’, to draw on the computer in an application called ‘Photoshop’. Yet, to be terribly honest, I did not achieve a high score for Art—a ‘B’—not because I was untalented, I just work very slow, and am even slower after injury. However, that does not diminish my love for this subject. Along with having played the oboe for 9 years (took the grade 8 exam, won at the Hong Kong Musical Festival and joined the Hong Kong Children’s Symphony Orchestra, school orchestras, had performances, etc), they also prove that I am patient. I can put up with slow working time as long as I know this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. In fact, spending more time on designs allows me to think through the alterations. And as mentioned, I do practice a lot through my redesign sketches so I am actually getting better at my artistic instincts and eye-hand coordination; I can draw faster now.\r\n\r\nWell, I did not do so well in my recent A-Level exams. But I can assure you, I am not stupid or lazy! Not at all! In truth I got mostly ‘A’s in my GCSE exams. Right now I spend most of my time doing physiotherapy (aka working out at the gym; boring stuff) and not enough time for revision. I firmly believe that I will do better in the future, both physically and academically, if given the opportunity.\r\n\r\nFrom the book I am currently reading, “If you can’t get a miracle, become one.” This is what I am trying to do—to succeed despite “the seemingly impossible odds”. I sincerely hope that my effort spent in this application is enough to persuade you to consider me for a place in this school, and eventually in the society. I could not agree more with the school motto, “To learn and to apply, for the benefit of mankind.” I would like to contribute to the society in the future too. In the end, like I said, I would love to be given the opportunity to study Character Design and thank you for spending the time to read through this.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nCynthia\r\n\r\n<h2>Thanks to…\r\n\r\n<h2>Time to Say Good-Bye</h2>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
